# **Introduction**
Welcome! This repo contains my thought process and current knowledge upon the machine learning topics I will be diving into. Some basics of Machine Learning that I have learned through the wonders of YouTube are:
* Weights and Biases
* Forward and Back Propogation
* Basics of Gradient Descent
* Activation Functions & Softmax / Argmax Functions

All the information along with said thought process can be viewed in the notebook!
